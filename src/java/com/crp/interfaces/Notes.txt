                              GENERAL NOTES ABOUT INTERFACE OBJECTS
                              -------------------------------------
              
The objects in interfaces are different from any other crp objects for the following reasons.

	- These objects are the only means with which any two crp components talk to each other
	- 
	- All the objects should strictly implement CommInterface and ObjectFactory interface methods
	- Any new variable added to the interface objects should make sure that the getObjectSize results in the
	  the correct object size.
